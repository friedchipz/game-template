# game-template

Problem:
    each time i want to start a project based on our engine
    it's a shitty time because i have to get the engine code
    set the environment and all this stuff.
Solution:
    create a template project that deals with all this so it
    can be
      * forked
      * run a script to get everything ready and set up
      * work on your new game project :D
      * if the engine gets updated, make it easy to update
        in the project as well
      * cooking script must build also the engine lib
        maybe even read some configuration to pin the engine
        version, and fetch-pull-checkout the engine repo
